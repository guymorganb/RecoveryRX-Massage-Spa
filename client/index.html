    <!--Key points for you Victoria ... everything above this line is basic SEO ^^^... there are some parts youll want to fill out.
        except the first 4 lines of HTML code.
        this HTML document is the entry point for your website. 

      Here are some notes to follow for the rest of your SEO:

      Schema Markup - This is a type of microdata that helps search engines parse the information on your page more efficiently. For a massage business, you might consider adding LocalBusiness schema.
      https://technicalseo.com/tools/schema-markup-generator/

Schema Markup is a code (semantic vocabulary) that you put on your website to help search engines return more informative results for users. It helps search engines understand the content on your page. For a massage business, you'd likely use the LocalBusiness schema, since you provide services in a particular location and probably have a physical address where you offer your services.

Here's what you should consider inputting into the Schema Markup Generator:

Type: Start by choosing Local Business from the dropdown menu.

General Information:

Name: RecoverRXMassage
Image: URL of a primary image/logo for your business.
Description: A short description of your business, such as "RecoverRXMassage offers professional massage therapy services to promote wellness and relaxation."
Telephone: Your business phone number.
URL: Your website URL.
Address:

Street: The street address of your business.
City: The city where your business is located.
State: Your state.
Postal Code: Your postal or ZIP code.
Country: Your country.
Geo-coordinates (optional, but can be helpful):

Latitude and Longitude of your business.
Opening Hours: If you have set business hours, input them here.

Social Profiles: Links to your business social media profiles (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc.)

Logo: The URL of your business logo.

After you've filled out the necessary information in the Schema Markup Generator, it will provide you with a script (in JSON-LD format) that you can add to the <head> section of your website, or use a plugin (if you're using CMS like WordPress) to integrate it.

Important: Ensure that the information you input is consistent with the details on your website and your Google My Business listing (if you have one). This consistency across different platforms is crucial for Local SEO.

    Title - This is important for SEO. It should be relevant to the content and services of the website.
    Meta Description - Gives search engines a brief overview of the content on your website. This sometimes appears in search results under the title.
    Open Graph Protocol (OGP) - Helps social media platforms understand your content when shared on platforms like Facebook.
    Twitter Card Meta - Enhances sharing on Twitter.
    Make sure to replace placeholders like URL_TO_AN_IMAGE_THAT_REPRESENTS_YOUR_BUSINESS and YOUR_WEBSITE_URL with actual content.
